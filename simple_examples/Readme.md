## Simple Manifests Templates

Note that Each manifest has four necessary parts:
1. The version of the API in use
2. The kind of resource youâ€™d like to define
3. Metadata about the resource
4. Though not required by all objects, a spec, which describes the desired behavior of the resource, is necessary for most objects and controllers.
